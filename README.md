# Network-Intrusion-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to detect network intrusions and classify malicious activities in an IoT environment. It uses a labeled dataset of network flows and applies preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and classification algorithms to predict threats accurately.
